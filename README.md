# stockMarket

This project aims to develop a Telegram bot integrated with various features such as messaging, Google Sign-In authentication, live stock market data scraping, and database management using PostgreSQL with maintained changelog. Future plans include integrating more security (ADMIN cms) and UI.

## Telegram Bot

The Telegram bot allows users to interact with various features through messaging. Users can send commands or requests to the bot to perform specific actions or retrieve information.

## Google Sign-In Feature

Google Sign-In integration allows users to authenticate and access the system using their Google accounts. This enhances security and simplifies the login process for users.

## Live Stock Market Data Scraping

The project includes functionality to scrape live data from the stock market. This data is retrieved from various sources and can be used for analysis or display purposes within the application.

## PostgreSQL Database with Changelog

PostgreSQL is used as the database management system for storing application data. A changelog is maintained to track and manage changes to the database schema over time, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

## Future Enhancements

- **More Security Integration**: Incorporating Spring Security to provide additional layers of authentication and authorization (Adding ADMIN CMS).
- **User Interface Improvements**: Enhancing the user interface for better usability and visual appeal.

Stay tuned for updates and further enhancements to this project!
